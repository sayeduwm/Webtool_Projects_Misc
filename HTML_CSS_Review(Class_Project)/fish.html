   <h2> Scout Lake Park</h2>
  <p>Scout Lake Park excels as a great place to fish, with a nice paved path around the Lake, which is good for strolls, walkers and runners. The DNR stocks this Lake with fish, so fishing off the pier will yield bluegill, perch and rainbow trout. There's also a resident snapping turtle you may see here. The pier can get crowded with anglers on weekends, so offtimes are great for visiting.</p>
  <p>There's an old County Parks property here, with men and women's bathrooms, and a small party room. There's not much green here to have a picnic, so Scout Lake probably wouldn't be the best place for your Stone Soul Picnic. I like the fishing here, so I'm sure I'll be back for many repeat trips. Located at 5902 West Loomis Rd Greendale, WI 53129</p>
